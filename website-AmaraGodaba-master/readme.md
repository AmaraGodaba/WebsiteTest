# CTEC3905 ASSIGNMENT
My website is made of four pages
home page - viewrs can see a sneak peak of the UK urban musicians.
Rappers page - viewers can use this page to learn about UK rappers with a brief description and listen to one of their must famous or iconic song.
Producer page - viwers can browse the and learn about the talented producers in the UK and learn about their work.
About  page -  the people viewing can understand the history behind making the page and can request an musician/producer to be added to the page
In this website page about UK rappers and producers, I have aimed to shed light on the rich and diverse music culture that this community has to offer. With a focus on emerging talent, the page features interviews, articles, and reviews providing an insight into the industry. As the genre continues to grow and evolve, it is important to celebrate the artists who are pushing boundaries and creating exciting new sounds. Through this page, I hope to showcase the importance and influence of UK rap and production.

my target audience are teenagers  that want to know what the UK rap has to offer. Whether you're a long-time fan or new to the scene, my website offers a fresh perspective on the vibrant world of UK rap.
content of this website 
I got all of my images from google images
And all of my songs from you tube 

I implemented a media query that adjusts the page layout to fit smaller screen sizes. The end result was a more user-friendly and functional website that can be viewed on any device, big or small.
